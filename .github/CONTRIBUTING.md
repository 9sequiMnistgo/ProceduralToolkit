## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs and issues
First, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen)
and [closed issues](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aclosed)
to see if your issue hasn't already been reported. If it does exist, add a :thumbsup: to the issue to 
indicate this is also an issue for you, and add a comment to the existing issue if there is extra information you can contribute.

If you can't find a matching issue, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues/new/choose),
choose the right template and provide us with enough information to investigate further. 
Alternatively, you can send a message to the [support email](mailto:proceduraltoolkit@syomus.com).

### Suggesting enhancements

[open a new issue](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues/new/choose) and describe in details what you have in mind.

### Proofreading

### Help wanted
If you're looking for something to work on, check out the 
[help wanted](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted") label. 
If you see something you like, please comment on the issue to let the development team know you are interested in the issue.

### Testing
Tests are always appreciated. If you see a feature that doesn't have sufficient test coverage (especially if it is [Geometry](Scripts/Geometry)-related), we would
be very grateful if you wrote some tests for it! Tests are written using the [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlaymodeTestFramework.html).

### Optimisation
If you love profiling and optimising existing code we would like to hear from you.
